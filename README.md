### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on a PhD project, which involves computational analysis of cell-cell interactions of the human hepatic microenvironment. Let's keep in touch if you are also working in this field or interested in networking.
Always happy to consider collaboration or contribute to a hackathon or an educational project. 

Self-taught in bioinformatics since 2016 and ongoing. Genomics -> single-cell transcriptomics -> ?.
